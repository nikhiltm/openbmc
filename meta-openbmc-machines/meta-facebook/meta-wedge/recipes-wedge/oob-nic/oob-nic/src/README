TODO:

1. Currently, we poll the SMbus instead of rely on the ALERT. The kernel does not handle the ALERT either other than just a print out.

2. Maximum fragment is 32

3. We use libnetlink for bring interface up and setting MAC. That increases the binary by about 50k and also we copied about 5 files from iproute2 here for that. We might be able to get away this by using some non-iproute2 API

4. The dependency in the Makefile does not consider .h
